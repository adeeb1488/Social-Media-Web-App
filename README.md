# Social Media App using MERN stack.
This project is inspired by JavaScript Mastery's project video "Build and Deploy a Full Stack MERN Social Media App with Auth, Pagination, Comments | MERN Course" video on YouTube. The link to the video is : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsUzmlZfYNg

This project is created using the MERN stack- MongoDB, Express js, React js and Node js. This project is a simple social media app that allows users to create posts. 

### Future imporvements
Currently only the basic functionality of the project is working and the remaining features are still in progress. The basic functionality of this web app includes- creating a post, editing a post and deleting a post.
